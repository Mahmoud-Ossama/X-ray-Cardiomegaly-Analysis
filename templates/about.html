            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, which can be a sign of several conditions including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Heart valve problems</li>
                    <li>Cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart muscle)</li>
                    <li>Coronary artery disease</li>
                    <li>Congenital heart defects</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Early detection of cardiomegaly can lead to improved patient outcomes through timely medical intervention.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Artificial Intelligence has shown promising results in assisting radiologists and medical professionals in the analysis of medical images. Deep learning models can be trained to identify patterns in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans that might indicate various medical conditions.</p>
                
                <p>Benefits of AI in medical imaging include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faster preliminary screening</li>
                    <li>Assistance to radiologists in high-volume environments</li>
                    <li>Potential for increased diagnostic accuracy</li>

                <p>This Cardiomegaly Classifier is a project developed for the AI College Bioinformatics Department. It demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to medical image analysis.</p>
                
                <p>The application uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on chest X-ray images to identify signs of heart enlargement. The model was trained using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data" target="_blank">NIH Chest X-ray dataset</a>.</p>
